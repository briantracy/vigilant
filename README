This software keeps track of how long you use your computer every day.
This is accomplished by creating a daemon that runs the included 
python script every 15 (by default) minutes while your computer is not
asleep. Each time the script is invoked, it writes this to file. When
you want to see your metrics, simply invoke the script to see a 
tabular readout.

Here is a typical readout:

$ vigilant
+-----------------+--------+
| Mon Mar 18 2019 | 02h45m |
+-----------------+--------+
| Tue Mar 19 2019 | 05h45m |
+-----------------+--------+


The following arguments are supported:
    1. -h, --help
    2. --checkpoint <int>
        This is called by the daemon every <int> minutes
    3. -l
        Prints the path of the LOG_FILE
